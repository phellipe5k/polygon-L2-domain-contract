# Polygon L2 Domain Contract

 This is a smaller version of ENS (Ethereum Name Service) on the Polygon blockchain.
 The project goes are basically let anyone buy a domain NFT and point it to something.
 
 The principal point that i'm using Polygon are the cheaper fees, with this we can build a scalable DApp.
